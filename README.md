Full-Stack Admin Dashboard with Server-Side Pagination, Charts, Sorting, and Analytics

This is a comprehensive full-stack project that includes an admin dashboard with powerful features for managing and visualizing data. The dashboard provides server-side pagination, various types of charts (pie, geography, line), sorting capabilities for products, customer activities, performance metrics, and detailed breakdowns of monthly and yearly sales. It is built with React, Material-UI, x-data-grid, Node.js, Express, CORS, and Nivo charts.

Features:
- Server-Side Pagination: Efficiently retrieve and display large datasets by implementing server-side pagination. This ensures optimal performance and reduces the amount of data transferred between the server and the client.
- Charts: Visualize data using different types of charts. The project includes pie charts to represent product categories, geography charts to show customer distribution, and line charts to display sales trends over time. Nivo charts library is used for creating beautiful and interactive visualizations.
- Sorting: Allow administrators to sort products based on various criteria such as price, popularity, or date added. Sorting functionality helps to organize and analyze data effectively.
- Customer Activities: Track and display customer activities, such as purchases, logins, or reviews. This feature provides valuable insights into user behavior and engagement.
- Performance Metrics: Monitor and display key performance metrics like response times, server load, or database queries. Performance metrics help administrators identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.
- Sales Breakdown: Provide detailed breakdowns of monthly and yearly sales, including revenue, units sold, and top-selling products. This information is useful for analyzing sales patterns and making data-driven decisions.

Technologies and Libraries Used:
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the efficient creation of reusable UI components.
- Material-UI: A UI component library that follows the Material Design guidelines. It provides pre-designed and customizable UI components for creating a visually appealing dashboard.
- x-data-grid: A highly flexible and customizable data grid component for React. It enables server-side pagination and sorting functionalities.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server-side API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
- CORS: A middleware for Express that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the dashboard to make API requests to different domains.
- Nivo charts: A powerful and customizable charting library for React. It provides various chart types and interactive features for data visualization.
